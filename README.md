## Deep Learning
Scope of project - develop TWO deep learning models (CNN and Transferred Learning) for the classification task with the given dataset


Characteristics of dataset
- classes - 4 (airplane, automobile, ship, truck)
- image size - 32 x 32
- train size - 2000 images per class, 8,000 in total in the train folder
- test size - 500 images per class, 2,000 in total in the test folder

Notebook consistent of
- data prep ; perform train/test/val split, normalize and put thru datagen
- CNN model ; reference CNN model, optimized CNN model
- transfer learning model ; reference transfer learning model with vgg16 + optimization and finetuning
- summary and comparison


## Machine Learning
Scope of project - Build
